campaigns.json specifies what DSP will be used.


1. There is a DSP-centric map of macros to Qortex url params. The pair is d_parameter name = dsp_macro.

2. Read macros from the tag and append them to the Qortex tag.
    Requirement: transfer to the tag only macros that original tag has.
    --> get all macros from the original tag (Regex?)
    --> Iterate through the map
    --> If Qortex macro is in the list of 3P tag macros:
        --> Append Qortex key to the Q tag with the corresponding macros.

3. On ad serving:
    - There is a map between Qortex parameters and DSP macros.
    - Iterated throw the map 
        --> get Qortex key 
        --> get macro from the map
        --> get value from the request (based on key) 
        --> replace macro on original tag with value

        Also, we should replace unexpended macros with arbitrary values. OR NOT
        DSP macro have macro convention - use the pattern for arbitrary values replacements.

4. There is 3P tag DSP and Qortex DSP  
    3P tag is DSP-centric. Are there cases when Qortex tag will be served through other than 3P DSP except for test campaigns?

5. VPAID perspective

Tag comes with DSP and VAST macros.

Server gets values. Values are associated with vast-centric and dsp-centric Qortex keys.

Server must expand macros on the 3P tags and write the tag with replaced values to AdParameters.

So, it is not VPAID's responsibility to handle macros at all?
